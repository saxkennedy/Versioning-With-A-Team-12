Over the summer I took two classes, and worked two jobs.  I got married; that was pretty great.  I also took a trip to Bloomington to visit some old friends.  Not a bad summer!

Over the summer I spent the majority of my time working and attempting to stay sane. I got the chance to take a trip to Pennsylvania to visit my girlfriend's family and go hiking through the mountains.

Over the summer I worked at a winery full time as soon as the spring semester ended. Unfortunately I worked so much that I was unable to travel as much as I would have liked to but the overtime pay was worth it!

Over the summer, I spent a lot of time at home taking care of my parents' house as they were out working most of every day. I was able to head down to Carmel to see my two best friends get married, so that great to see.

I had a pretty lazy summer -- lots of Netflix, YouTube, and a few games like TF2 and EU4. Besides that, I got to spend Fridays with my adorable little 2 year old nephew Calvin, who is the greatest source of joy in my life.
